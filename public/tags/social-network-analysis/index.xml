      <description>Project Date: September 2021 - December 2021&#xA;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 was the last episode of the legendary series. In this movie, Harry has finally grown into a steely lad on a mission to rid the world of evil, and the friends must search for the Horcruxes that keep the dastardly wizard immortal.&#xA;Our research objectives in the project included studying the overall sentimental change as the story develops, comparing the word and sentiment between the two centers of the story - Harry and Voldemort, comparing the sentiment between the movie and the book, analyzing through the movie reviews to find if the movie was too dark compared to previous series.</description>
